Abstract
Financial markets are complex and uncertain, making single-model trading systems unreliable.
This project proposes a Hybrid Multi-Agent Decision Support System 
It integrates rule-based filtering, predictive analytics, reinforcement learning, and risk management.
Specialized agents independently analyse:
Market trend and momentum alignment
Technical structure and volatility behaviour
Predictive directional confidence
Risk feasibility and trade management
A Weighted Decision Fusion mechanism combines agent outputs
The system generates explainable, ranked trade recommendations.
The framework aims to improve decision reliability, adaptability, and risk control
Designed for real-world usability with controlled automation.

Introduction
Financial trading decisions involve multiple interacting factors, not a single signal
Traders often struggle to filter high-quality opportunities from market noise
Rule-based systems lack adaptability under changing market conditions
Pure AI models behave as black boxes and ignore trading discipline
Effective trading requires coordination between analysis, execution, and risk control
Human traders naturally follow a multi-step decision process
Translating this decision process into a structured AI system is challenging
This project explores a multi-agent approach to model real trading workflows

--- Slide ppt/slides/slide4.xml ---
Motivation
Traders often face information overload with conflicting market signals
Many AI trading models fail in real markets due to lack of risk control
Over-automation in trading systems increases financial and operational risk
There is a gap between academic trading models and practical usability
Experienced traders follow structured, rule-driven decision processes
AI systems rarely replicate this disciplined workflow
Desire to combine human trading logic with adaptive intelligence
To design a Multi-Agent Framework for algorithmic swing trading
To decompose market analysis into specialized autonomous agents
To implement a Weighted Signal Fusion mechanism for decision synthesis
To train a Reinforcement Learning agent for adaptive entry and exit strategies

Literature Review
Title of the Paper
Journal / Source
Dataset Used
Key Contributions
Other Observations / Limitations
A-Trader: A Multi-Agent System for Financial Trading
Applied Intelligence (Springer), 2024
Forex market historical data
Proposed a modular multi-agent trading system with task-specific agents and decision aggregation
Focused mainly on Forex; limited use of deep learning and no reinforcement learning adaptation
TradingAgents: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Financial Trading
arXiv, 2024
U.S. stock market data
Introduced collaborative agent roles (technical, fundamental, risk) inspired by trading firms
Uses LLMs; computationally expensive and not optimized for real-time trading
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management
Global Finance Journal, 2024
DJIA, S&P-100 historical data
Applied actor-critic RL models for dynamic portfolio allocation with risk control
Does not integrate multi-agent signal analysis or technical patterns
Hybrid LSTM-PPO Model for Portfolio Optimization
arXiv, 2025
Multi-asset equity and crypto datasets
Combined LSTM forecasting with PPO-based reinforcement learning for improved returns
Focused on portfolio weights; lacks agent-based decomposition
Sentiment Analysis in Financial Markets Using BERT
IEEE Access, 2023
Financial news headlines (Reuters, Bloomberg)
Demonstrated effectiveness of NLP-based sentiment in enhancing trading decisions
Sentiment treated independently; not integrated into a unified decision framework

Innovation
Multi-agent architecture inspired by real trading desk workflows
Clear separation of analysis, decision, and risk control responsibilities
Confidence-weighted fusion to rank trade opportunities objectively
Probabilistic prediction instead of unreliable price forecasting
Reinforcement learning applied only to post-entry trade management
Rule-guided learning to prevent unstable AI behavior
Explainable recommendations with transparent decision rationale
Modular design enabling easy future extensions

Proposed Methodology
Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Collect historical OHLCV data from Yahoo Finance and NSE Bhav Copy
Perform data cleaning, normalization, and time-series feature engineering
Step 2: Rule-Based Candidate Selection
Market Trend Agent evaluates overall market direction
Rule-Based Eligibility Agent applies trend template criteria
Filters stocks based on trend alignment, liquidity, and volatility
Step 3: Technical & Momentum Analysis
Technical Structure Agent analyzes price structure and momentum
Identifies volatility contraction, breakout readiness, and relative strength
Step 4: Predictive Analytics
Predictive Analytics Agent estimates directional probability
Uses ML/DL models to generate confidence scores (not price targets)
Step 5: Confidence-Based Signal Fusion
Outputs from all agents are combined
Composite Confidence Score (CCS) is computed
High-quality trade opportunities are ranked and shortlisted
Step 6: Reinforcement Learning Trade Management
RL agent activates after trade entry
Optimizes hold, trail stop, partial exit, or full exit decisions
Step 7: Portfolio Risk Validation & Execution
Portfolio Risk Agent enforces position sizing and drawdown limits
Approved recommendations are displayed or executed in controlled mode
